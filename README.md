# AppleMusictoMP3
download your Apple Music Playlist as MP3 

All extra reqiurments beside the imports at the top are Youtube-DL requirements, you mihgt have to install FFmpeg.

in order to use the code all you need is to turn your playlist to an XML file by doing the following:
On iTunes/Apple Music go to File -> Library -> Export playlist... and export it as XML to your project's directory
last thing you got to do is to replace the file inside the call to mainfunc to your playlists file name and run it!
